EVTDESCmkmod.7;One way or another, fate has brought you to the Mamluks, a brotherhood you will belong to for the rest of your life. The Mamluks, while technically slaves, are not treated as such they are taught how to bear arms, praise God and in some cases are even educated! As a Mamluk, you will immediately enjoy a social class not quite that of a lord, but above the lowborn folk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmkmod.7;I can't complain about that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmkmod.8;Wandering slave traders from far away have come to sell you their prized slaves.

EVTOPTAmkmod.9;Let us hope that I use my influence wisely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmkmod.10;One way or another, a Russian Prince has risen up and taken on the ambition of reforming the Rus' Empire!

EVTOPTAmkmod.10;The Empire has returned and we are it's warriors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmkmod.10;No, we have too much to lose, this petty lord doesn't deserve our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmkmod.11;Once created to defend the Rus' Emperor, the Druzhina are a military social caste like no other. Treated like lords and as rich as merchants, the Druzhina exist outside of normal rulership, an entity unto themselves within the Empire. Though, times are dark in Rus'. There is no clear king of Russia and the only thing that holds russians together is their faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmkmod.11;But these are great times for us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmkmod.12;Hired as the Polish King's most trusted household guard, the Polish Druzhina exist to keep the Polish Crown safe as well as to gain some wealth and glory on the side.

EVTDESCmkmod.14;The ancestral lands of the Picts have been conquered! Morale is at an all time high, the men of the Pictish Host cheer and drink to their new king. They have sworn to act as the household guard of the reclaimer against all aggressors, foreign or domestic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmkmod.14;You have served me well, let us rejoice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmkmod.15;The Pictish Host was created with the intention of creating a strong Pictish peoples and have decided that you are not a worthy liege for them. As such, they now accept another as their Marshall and have completely rejected your rule. Furthermore, this upstart warlord also states that you are not worthy to hold your entire country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmkmod.15;Good Riddance. I don't need those filthy Picts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAmkmod.17;I have found solitude in the Christ God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmkmod.17;Execute the preachers, Odin, Thor and Frey are the only way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
